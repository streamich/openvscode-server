# Workspaces

When you work with Gitpod, your goal is to open as many workspaces as possible ;-). To be more specific, you want to open a new workspace for each task you work on. We call this ephemeral workspaces.

## Benefits of ephemeral workspaces

### Latest code

Each new workspace contains the latest code. There's no need for you to take care of that.

As an added bonus, if you open a Gitpod workspace from an issue URL, Gitpod automatically creates a branch for you! All you need to do is write the code, commit & push.

### Latest dependencies

Each new workspace also has the most up-to-date versions of app & operating system dependencies. Another thing you don't have to worry about.

### Work in parallel

Say you're working on a feature and a team member asks you to review their pull request. Start a new workspace, review the code, close the workspace - and you're back in your feature environment where you continue to work.
